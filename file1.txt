# Tasks To Be Performed:
1. Create 2 Ansible roles
2. Install Apache2 on slave1 using one role and NGINX on slave2 using the
other role
3. Above should be implemented using different Ansible roles

Go To AWS Management Comsole And create 3 ec2 instances 1 is master node and 2 is slave node.
Install the ansible in master node 

sudo apt update-y 
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt install ansible

Then go to cd /etc/ansible in ansible master server

sudo nano hosts
[werserver]
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx(mention here your ip address)
[prod]
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx(mention here your ip address)

then save it

Before we need to below task completion
Now Need to create the passwordless ssh slave 1 and slave 2
go to master server and type the command ssh-keygeb -t rsa
after rune this command go to cd /.ssh/
cat id_rsa.pub and copy this key

and paste in slave 1 and slave in path  /home/ubuntu/.ssh/
and cat authorized_key
paste here key you have just copy and save it then exit this file 
then type command ssh xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx(ip address of your machine)
if you asked some popup just type yes 

Now you got connected your machine with ansible master with passwordless authentication.

then run this command 
ansible -m ping all

#1.	Create 2 Ansible roles

To create ansible roles:
sudo ansible-galaxy init apache
sudo ansible-galaxy init nginx

#2. Install Apache2 on slave1 using one role and NGINX on slave2 using the other role
path of Ansible Apache role
/etc/ansible/roles/apache/tasks/
path of Ansible nginx role
/etc/ansible/roles/nginx/tasks/
add the yaml playbook files inside tasks

First need to set the apache task

So to this path /etc/ansible/roles/apache/tasks/ here You need to create the file name is install.yaml

 sudo nano install.yaml write this code and save it then exit this file
---
-	name: install apache
apt:
 name: apache2
  state: present
Then after you will main.yaml file open this file 
Sudo nano main.yaml.write this code in main.yaml and save it this and exit from file.
 ---
-	name: include apache installation tasks
include_tasks: install.yaml

Then go to /etc/ansible/roles/nginx/tasks/ path 
Create one file like install.yaml.write this code 
---
-	 name: Install Nginx
apt:
   name: nginx
    state: present
Sudo nano main.yaml.write this code in main.yaml and save it this and exit from file.
 ---
-	name: include Nginx installation tasks
include_tasks: install.yaml

      Then go to this path cd /etc/ansible and create one more file for installing 
     Apache and nginx like name is play.yaml

finally create a playbook to execute the tasks of the role and write this below code in play.yaml
---
— name: installing apache2
hosts: webserver
become: true
roles:
— apache

- name: installing nginx
hosts: prod
become: true
roles:
— nginx

Now Save it this yaml.we need to deploy the both apache and nginx through role based.
Now Run this command.the command is
ansible-playbook play3.yaml
After complete the deployment go to aws instance and copy the public ip and paste it to browser.
